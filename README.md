# [MilkyTracker.html](MilkyTracker.html)
The one true source of the [MilkyTracker user manual](MilkyTracker.html).

## Usage
- Users: Read it. Challenge it. Suggest edits. Hug your mom.
- Developers: Use as a submodule in the [application](https://github.com/milkytracker/MilkyTracker) and [website](https://github.com/milkytracker/milkytracker.github.io) repositories instead of kicking around multiple easily diverging copies.

## Editing
- Please try to write [valid](https://validator.nu/#textarea), semantic HTML 5.
- Use progressive enhancement only. Make sure the manual *just works* without frills.
- The current mode of styling is minimal and respecting of user defaults. Theming should be done with external style sheets.
- In more recent versions of MilkyTracker, the manual is also readable within the program so please check your work renders sanely with `lynx -dump MilkyTracker.html` before committing.

## History
This repository was founded after a post-release maintenance checkup revealed differing copies of the manual in our repos. They were merged, checked and validated and while it wasn't that bad, it's nevertheless a chore we would not like to keep repeating.
